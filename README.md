# BCB546-PythonHW_Spring2022

This repository comprises of my Jupyter notebook for the translation of amino acid sequences.
The code runs well.

Please be sure to  install a  corresponding package in case you may not aleady have it installed by simply removing the `#` infront of the code.

It also contains a .csv file created upon computing the Molecular weights and GC content.
I have also included the files for the Penguins that the code works with

Good luck
